NAME
       odfmeta - List or change the metadata of an ODF file

SYNOPSIS
       odfmeta [-l] [-v] [-V] [-c] [-d] [-x metafield...] [-X metafield...] [-a metafield...] [-A metafield...] [-I metafield...] [-o path] path

DESCRIPTION
       odfmeta is a program that will list or change the metadata in an OpenDocument file. This is useful for version control systems. You can change
       title, keywords, description etc.

       “Path” is assumed to be an OpenDocument file of text, spreadsheet or presentation type.

OPTIONS
       -l
           List (extract) all known metadata fields.

       -v or -V
           Print the version number of the ODF document format. If you use -V it will print "version:" before the number for compatibility with -X.
           The version number can't be modified.

       -c
           Make field values continuous by normalizing white space. Might be convenient when postprocessing with standard (line oriented) text
           utilities.

       -d
           Update the modification date to the current date and time.

       -x metafield
           Extract the contents of this metafield from the file. Known field names are creation-date, creator, date, description, editing-cycles,
           editing-duration, generator, initial-creator, keyword, language, print-date, printed-by, subject, title, user-defined. All other names are
           assumed to be user defined.

       -X metafield
           Same as -x, but also preserves/includes the field name.

       -a metafield
           Append a custom metafield to the metadata; but only if a similar field does not exist yet.

       -A metafield
           Append a custom metafield to the metadata in any case.

       -I metafield
           Append a custom metafield to the metadata and remove any existing similar field.

       -o path
           Filename to write modified ODT file to. If no -o option is provided, the ODT file will be written to stdout.

EXAMPLES
           odfmeta -l odf-file.odt
           odfmeta -I "title:The Little Engine That Could" -A subject:I-think-I-can -o newfile.odt source.odt

SEE ALSO
       formail(1), id3tag(1)

BUGS
       All known versions of OpenOffice.org keep only four <meta:user-defined> elements. If you add more than those, you'll loose them next time you
       save with OpenOffice.org. KOffice keeps only one <meta:keyword> element.
