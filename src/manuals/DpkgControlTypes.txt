NAME
       Dpkg::Control::Types - export CTRL_* constants

DESCRIPTION
       You should not use this module directly. Instead you more likely want to use Dpkg::Control which also re-exports the same constants.

       This module has been introduced solely to avoid a dependency loop between Dpkg::Control and Dpkg::Control::Fields.
